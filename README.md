# Finding-donors-for-CharityML
Using supervised learning models to identify most likely donor for charityML.
Out of seven available  supervised learning model , I have chosen three model to perfrorm on my trianing data set and then predict.
The three model chosen are :-
i). Decision Trees
ii).SVM
iii). KNN classifiers

After comparing the result obtained from all the three models I have chosen Knn classifire beacuse of its best performance and then optimized it by tuning its parameters to better the resuls.

Scikit Learn libraries and Pandas are used.
